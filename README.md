<h1>Calorie-Tracker </h1>

<h2>Project Description </h2>

Calorie-Tracker is a web application designed to support students’ dietary goals by helping them track their calorie intake and recommending food options available on UBC campus. Students can easily log their daily food, visualize a breakdown of their food intake, and receive restaurant and food suggestions based on menus’ nutrition facts. 

<h3>Who is it for: </h3>
<ul>
  <li>UBC student</li>
</ul>

<h3>What will it do:</h3> 
<ul>
<li>Allow students to filter restaurant options based on allergies and dietary requirements</li>
<li>Allow students to visualize their dietary patterns</li>
</ul>

<h3>What type of data will it store:</h3>  

<ul>
  <li>Restaurant & menu (calories) </li>
  <li> User profile: name, diatery preference, weight, height, authentication: (username, password) </li>
  <li>Session (tokens)</li>
</ul>
 
<h3>What will user be able to do with the data:</h3>   

<ul>
  <li>Recieve food recommendations food options based on caloric intake, location and time</li>
  <li>Input and track their calories goals</li>
</ul>

<h3>Addtional Features based on time constraint:</h3> 
<ul>
  <li>Snack recommendations</li> 
</ul>

    <li> REST API to save and fetch data from the database </li>
    <li> Make a Schema to sanitise and validate data to be stored in the database document </li>
